### d. Financial Equation & Business Model Analysis

Our financial model is based on a SaaS business with tiered pricing targeting the EV analytics market.

#### Revenue Model

**Revenue Equation for our AI EV Analytics Platform:**
```
Total Annual Revenue = Subscription Revenue + Consulting Revenue + Custom Reports Revenue
```

Where:
```
Subscription Revenue = (Basic Plan Price × Basic Plan Customers × 12) + 
                       (Pro Plan Price × Pro Plan Customers × 12) + 
                       (Enterprise Plan Price × Enterprise Plan Customers × 12)

Consulting Revenue = Hourly Rate × Annual Consulting Hours
Custom Reports Revenue = Average Report Price × Number of Reports
```

**Pricing Structure:**
* Basic Plan: ₹50,000/month (₹6,00,000/year)
* Professional Plan: ₹1,25,000/month (₹15,00,000/year)
* Enterprise Plan: ₹3,00,000+/month (₹36,00,000+/year)

#### Cost Structure

**Total Cost Equation:**
```
Total Annual Cost = Fixed Costs + Variable Costs
```

Where:
```
Fixed Costs = Development Team Cost + Infrastructure Cost + Administrative Cost
Variable Costs = Data Acquisition Cost + Marketing Cost + Customer Support Cost
```

**Estimated Cost Breakdown:**
* Development Team: ₹1,20,00,000/year (45% of total costs)
* Infrastructure: ₹40,00,000/year (15%)
* Administrative: ₹26,67,000/year (10%)
* Data Acquisition: ₹40,00,000/year (15%)
* Marketing & Sales: ₹26,67,000/year (10%)
* Customer Support: ₹13,33,000/year (5%)

#### Profit Model

**Profit Equation:**
```
Annual Profit = Total Annual Revenue - Total Annual Cost
Profit Margin = Annual Profit / Total Annual Revenue
```

#### 5-Year Financial Projection
